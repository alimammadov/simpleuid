# simpleuid

The probability of generating a duplicate UID with this algorithm is very low, but it is still possible.

The algorithm randomly selects characters from the alphabet array and the numbers array, so there is a chance that the same character may be selected multiple times during the generation of a UID.

To minimize the chance of generating a duplicate UID, you can check if the generated UID already exists in the database or array of existing UIDs, and if it does, generate a new one. You can also increase the length of the UID to further decrease the probability of duplicates.


I created check.js file which is check if UID already exists.

The isUidUnique function takes a UID as its argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the UID already exists in the database. You can then call createUid with this function to generate a new UID that is guaranteed to be unique.


In this example, db.checkUidExists is a hypothetical function that checks whether a given UID already exists in the database and returns a boolean. The isUidUnique function simply negates the result of db.checkUidExists, so it returns true if the UID does not exist in the database and false if it does.

The createUid function generates a new UID using the same algorithm as before, but it continues generating UIDs until it finds one that is not already in the database.
